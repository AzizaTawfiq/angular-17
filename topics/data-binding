# Data binding

Data binding is a mechanism in Angular that allows you to bind data from a component to a template, and vice versa.
There are two types of data binding in Angular:

1. One-way data binding: This is the most common type of data binding in Angular. It allows you to bind data from a component to a template, but not the other way around.
   From component to template:

a- property binding: it is used to bind a property of a component to a template.
for example:

<div [title]="title">

b- attribute binding: it is used to bind an attribute of a component to a template.???
for example:

<div [attr.status]="status">
c- interpolation : it is used to bind a property of a component to a template using the {{ }} syntax.
for example:
<p >{{title}}</p> // the html output is is the value of title property in the component
<p ngNonBindable>{{title}}</p> // ngNonBindable is used to prevent binding  and the output in html will be {{title}} instead of the value of title variable
 d- class binding: it is used to bind a class of a component to a template.
 for example:
 <div [class.active]="isActive">
 <div [class]="isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'"> //using ternary operator to bind the class
 e- style binding: it is used to bind a style of a component to a template.
 for example:
 <p [style.color]="isRed ? 'red' : 'green'"></p>
 <p [style]="isRed ? 'background-color:red' : 'background-color: green' "></p> // using ternary operator to bind style

From template to component:
a- event binding: it is used to bind an event of a template to a component ().
for example:
<button (click)="onClick()">click < button>

2. Two-way data binding:
   This type of data binding allows you to bind data from a component to a template, and also allows the template to update the component's data.
   For example:
   in html
   <input
   [(ngModel)]="name"
   name="name"
   placeholder="Enter name">
   />
   in ts
   export class AppComponent {
   name = 'Angular';
   changeName(){
   this.name = 'Angular 2';
   }
   }

# what different between property binding and interpolation?

interpolation is always return string value, while property binding can return any type of value.
